# C - Static libraries

In this project, I learned what static libraries are and practiced creating and
using them with `ar`, `ranlib`, and `nm`.

## Tests :heavy_check_mark:

* [tests](./tests): Folder of test files. Provided by Holberton School.

* **1. Without libraries what have we? We have no past and no future**
  * [create_static_lib.sh](./create_static_lib.sh): Bash script that creates a static
  library called `liball.a` from all the `.c` files in the current directory.
